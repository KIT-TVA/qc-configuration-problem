# ðŸ’¡ Addressing the Configuration Problem via Quantum Computing

Repository serves as playground for the configuration problem in QuBRA

## Installation

Clone (or download) this repository and install dependencies via pip:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## ToDo List (will be updated)
- [ ] Import feature models with attributes (DIMACS?)
- [ ] Use Grover-Algorithm to find the optimal configuration (i.e., construct phase oracle)
- [ ] Use Quantum-Tree-Walk (and BDDs) as alternative
- [ ] ...
